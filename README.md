# WesNxReactNativeExpo

This project was generated using [Nx](https://nx.dev). [NX autogenerated boilerplate README found here](NXBOILERPLATEREADME.md)

## Setup

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone git@github.com:westhechiang/wes-nx-react-native-expo.git

# Install dependencies
yarn

# To run development server; see prompts for how to start iOS, web, and android
npx nx start sample-expo-app

# To build for EAS for the first time

# NOTE: The following nx workspace command runs with --non-interactive (see workspace.json L16) and so if this is your first time,
# you need to run the following and run through the wizard:
cd apps/sample-expo-app && npx eas-cli build --clear-cache --platform android


# To build for EAS subsequently
npx nx easbuild sample-expo-app
```
